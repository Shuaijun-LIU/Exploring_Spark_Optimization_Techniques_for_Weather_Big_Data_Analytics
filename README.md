## For METCS777 term paper (Team11)

Dear Prof.Pham and TA,

In the 'data' section, you can see the small dataset of hourly weather data and station information data for the last 10 years in Japan that we used to train the model, which are distributed and stored in json and csv formats in the '2014_2024' and 'station_ infor' folders. Other supporting files can also be found in 'data', such as additional information for visualizing the dataset, and a 'readme' file exists for the dataset for detailed description.

In the 'code' section, we have divided the data processing, modeling and prediction into three parts, including:1. Initial data visualization and acquisition. 2. modeling and prediction without applying spark and its optimization techniques. 3. modeling and prediction after using spark and its optimization techniques. In which the third part is the focus of exploration in this term paper, we used optimization techniques such as data caching to analyze over 10gb of meteorological big data and modeled it with good results.

When PRESENTATION, we were not able to show too many details of the code due to time constraints, so hopefully this will help you understand more here.

Best,
Shuaijun Liu, Xinyi Xie
